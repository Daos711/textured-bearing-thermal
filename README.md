# Textured Bearing Thermal Model

Numerical simulation of a hydrodynamic sliding bearing with textured surface.
The project extends a previous isothermal model by adding temperature-dependent
fluid properties and thermal–hydrodynamic coupling.

Planned features:
- Reynolds equation solver with surface texturing
- Energy equation / temperature field
- Postprocessing: pressure, film thickness, stiffness, damping, rotor orbits
